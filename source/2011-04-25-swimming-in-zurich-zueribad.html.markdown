My first android application is a utility app about all public swimming baths
in Zurich. It shows the current water temperature for each bath and additional
information is available too, such as address and routing info (how to get
there by public transportation). Google map integration provides a geographical
overview of the baths.

The app is freely available in the [android
market](https://market.android.com/details?id=org.koffeinfrei.zueribad).  The
source code is hosted on
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/koffeinfrei/zueribad/).
