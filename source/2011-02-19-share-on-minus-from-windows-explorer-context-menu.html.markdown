Thereâ€™s a new tool for the file sharing service [minus.com](http://minus.com)
that makes it really easy to share files.  The tool provides a context menu
entry in the windows explorer and a simple user interface to upload the files
and provide you with the share url.

The tool is on [github](https://github.com/koffeinfrei/MinusShare).
