At my workplace we have a coffee automat which I didn’t consider more
than just being my coffee supplier. Yesterday I noticed though that it
has some peculiar beverage on offer. It’s called "Weisses Getränk mit
Kaffee" (that was German), and for the English speaking folks the
translation would be like "White beverage with coffee" (that was
English). That really sounds ominous. Maybe I don’t want to try that
one…    
By the way, sorry for the crappy fotograph, the camera of my cellphone
lacks almost everything that would make it a good camera.
