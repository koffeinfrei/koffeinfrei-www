title: navigate to those... out of the box with firefox

Ok well, this doesn’ seem to be new at all, but nevertheless I missed that.
Firefox has the great functionality to assign shortcuts to certain bookmarks
and supply a parameter to the URL. This leads to really great [quick
searches](http://lifehacker.com/software/geek-to-live/geek-to-live-fifteen-firefox-quick-searches-129658.php)
(aka. [the art of
bookmarking](http://lifehacker.com/196779/hack-attack-firefox-and-the-art-of-keyword-bookmarking)).

What I have now are shortcuts to all my often used search sites. To search in
wikipedia e.g. I type `CTRL + L` (shortcut for placing the cursor in the
[URL]{.caps} bar in firefox), then type `wp asdf` and there I go.

I guess this fact renders [my previously posted quick link access
tool](/2009/05/15/navigate-to-those-urls-over-and-over-again) obsolete…
