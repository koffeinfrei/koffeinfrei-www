title: replace as in batch replace

So I once again needed to replace several patterns in multiple files with
something new… Windows lacks a nice terminal with all the pipeable tools.
Instead of doing this all in my favorite text editor by using repeatedly
find/replace, I decided that something more handy was needed.  Of course I
could have done all that replace stuff with xslt too, for even more awesomeness
(you can’t see my face, that what sarcasm).

The result of my disapproval of the above mentioned options is the Batch
Replacer. As always it is released under the gpl. I also used
[git](http://git-scm.com/) for the first time and published the [source code
on github](http://github.com/koffeinfrei/batchreplacer).
