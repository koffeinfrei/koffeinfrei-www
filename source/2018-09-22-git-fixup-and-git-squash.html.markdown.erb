Related to my blogpost [The Git fixup
workflow](/2018/09/18/the-git-fixup-workflow/) [I wrote two git
scripts](https://github.com/koffeinfrei/dotfiles/commit/55d54c5c201b398dca1af359f44e0a5161c17bfa)
`git fixup` and `git squash` to support that workflow.

Both scripts assume that you are working on a separate branch (feature branch)
from your default branch (which is mostly `master`).

## 1. Git fixup

This script is a substitute for `git commit --fixup <COMMIT HASH>`. The problem
with using `--fixup` is that it requires you to first get the hash of the
commit you wish to fixup to and provide it as an argument.

This script removes
that burden by relying on
[selecta](https://github.com/garybernhardt/selecta) to provide a list of all
previous commits in the current branch. The selected commit will then be used
to create a fixup commit for.

## 2. Git squash

This script is a substitute for `git rebase -i --autosquash`. The problem with
squashing all fixup commits is that you have to find the earliest commit you
want to rebase onto.

This script rebases to the first commit in the current branch and squashes all
fixup commits.
