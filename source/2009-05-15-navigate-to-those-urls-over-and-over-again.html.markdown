title: navigate to those urls over and over again...

Iâ€™ve written a tool that allows to define commonly used URLs for repeated
access, varying only by a defined parameter-part. When you call one of those
URLs, you just need to pass a parameter and it opens in the browser. That way
you get quick access to often used URLs, e.g. your preferred search engine,
your ticketing system or whatever. For even faster access the URLs are bound to
predefined global hotkeys.
